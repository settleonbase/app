    <h1>Terms of Use — Settle</h1>
    <p class="muted">Settle is a non-custodial web interface to smart contracts on Base using x402.</p>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="acceptance">
      <h2>1) Acceptance</h2>
      <p>By accessing or using <strong>Settle</strong> (the “Service”)—including connecting a wallet, minting, or transacting via the x402 protocol on Base—you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="what-settle-is">
      <h2>2) What Settle Is</h2>
      <p>Settle is a web interface to smart contracts that enable gas-sponsored (“gasless”) transactions using <strong>x402</strong> on <strong>Base</strong>. Settle is <strong>non-custodial</strong>: we do not hold or control user assets or keys. On-chain actions occur via smart contracts you choose to interact with.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="eligibility">
      <h2>3) Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 and not subject to sanctions or other prohibitions under applicable laws. You are responsible for ensuring the Service is legal where you use it.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="wallets-security">
      <h2>4) Wallets &amp; Security</h2>
      <p>You use third-party wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet) at your own risk. Protect your seed phrase and private keys. We cannot recover keys, reverse transactions, or freeze funds.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="fees">
      <h2>5) Fees, Sponsorship &amp; Limits</h2>
      <p>Transactions may be gas-sponsored via x402 subject to availability, quotas, and risk controls. We may throttle, deny, or revoke sponsorship at any time. Network, protocol, or third-party fees may still apply. Prices and limits can change without notice.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="token-disclosures">
      <h2>6) Token Disclosures — <strong>$SETTLE</strong></h2>
      <p>Interacting with <strong>$SETTLE</strong> may involve volatility and loss of value. <strong>$SETTLE does not represent equity, profit rights, or claims on revenues</strong> and confers no governance or other rights unless explicitly stated in official documentation. Nothing here is investment, legal, or tax advice.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="sale">
      <h2>7) Token Sale / Pre-Sale (Mint)</h2>
      <h3>a. Overview</h3>
      <p>We may enable a token sale or pre-sale (the “<strong>Mint</strong>”). Users send supported assets (e.g., USDC on Base) to the sale contract to acquire <strong>$SETTLE</strong>.</p>
      <h3>b. Pending balance display</h3>
      <p>After you complete a Mint transaction, the interface may display an informational “Pending <strong>$SETTLE</strong>” balance. This is not a transfer of tokens; it reflects your provisional entitlement based on on-chain receipts.</p>
      <h3>c. Distribution mechanics</h3>
      <p>When the Mint period ends and the sale controller toggles the distribution switch, the sale contract releases <strong>$SETTLE</strong> on-chain to eligible purchasers’ addresses according to the contract logic (including any caps, pro-rata allocations, or refunds).</p>
      <h3>d. Caps, oversubscription &amp; pro-rata</h3>
      <p>If the sale has a hard cap or is oversubscribed, allocations may be reduced pro-rata. Any excess funds, if applicable, will be refundable by the contract to the original sending address.</p>
      <h3>e. Cancellations and refunds</h3>
      <p><strong>All Mint transactions are final</strong> once confirmed on-chain, except to the extent the contract expressly supports refunds (e.g., oversubscription returns) or if we publicly cancel the sale before distribution, in which case the contract will enable refunds of contributed funds. We do not process off-chain refunds.</p>
      <h3>f. Eligibility &amp; compliance</h3>
      <p>You represent that you are legally permitted to participate, are not a prohibited person (e.g., OFAC-sanctioned), and are not purchasing on behalf of such persons. We may restrict regions or users and may require additional checks where legally necessary.</p>
      <h3>g. No investment solicitation</h3>
      <p>Participation in a Mint is not an offer or solicitation of securities or any financial instrument. <strong>$SETTLE</strong> provides no rights except as expressly stated in official documentation and the token’s smart contracts.</p>
      <h3>h. Distribution delays &amp; risks</h3>
      <p>Distribution may be delayed or paused due to security reviews, audits, abuse mitigation, or network conditions. We may suspend or abort a sale for any reason before distribution.</p>
      <h3>i. Taxes</h3>
      <p>You are solely responsible for any taxes arising from your participation.</p>
      <h3>j. Contract precedence</h3>
      <p>If there is any discrepancy between the interface and the smart contracts, <strong>the smart contracts control</strong>.</p>

      <p>THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED <strong>“AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE”</strong> WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND.

    </section>

    <section id="arbitration">
      <h2>14) Binding Arbitration; Class-Action &amp; Jury Waivers (Delaware-Seated)</h2>
      <p><strong>a. Agreement to Arbitrate.</strong> Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Service (“Disputes”) will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except (i) either party may bring an individual claim in small-claims court; and (ii) either party may seek temporary injunctive or equitable relief in court to protect confidential information or intellectual property pending arbitration.</p>
      <p><strong>b. Rules, Seat, and Governing Law.</strong> Arbitration will be administered by <strong>JAMS</strong> under its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules &amp; Procedures (or Streamlined Rules, if applicable). The seat/venue is <strong>Wilmington, Delaware, USA</strong>. The Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware (without regard to conflicts-of-law rules). The language will be English.</p>
      <p><strong>c. Arbitrator &amp; Procedure.</strong> A single arbitrator will preside and has exclusive authority to resolve arbitrability, enforceability, and scope (including formation and unconscionability). Discovery will be limited to what the arbitrator deems reasonably necessary. The award will be confidential and binding and may be entered in any court with jurisdiction.</p>
      <p><strong>d. Fees.</strong> JAMS fees will be allocated as required by the applicable rules; the arbitrator may award fees and costs as permitted by law. If you demonstrate that arbitration costs would be prohibitive, we will consider good-faith adjustments consistent with JAMS policies.</p>
      <p><strong>e. Class-Action &amp; Jury Waivers.</strong> You and we waive any right to a jury trial. Disputes must be brought on an individual basis; class, collective, or representative actions or arbitrations are not permitted.</p>
      <p><strong>f. Opt-Out.</strong> You may opt out of this arbitration agreement within <strong>30 days</strong> of first accepting these Terms by emailing <strong>info@settleonbase.xyz</strong> with the subject “Opt-Out of Arbitration.” If you opt out, this Section 14 will not apply and exclusive venue will be the state or federal courts in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>

    <section id="changes">
