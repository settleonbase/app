    <div class="card-shell">
      <p class="subtitle">
        Welcome to Beamio (the “Service”). These Terms of Use (“Terms”) are a legal agreement between you (“you”, “user”) and
        [Beamio, Inc.] (“Beamio”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) governing your access to and use of our website at
        <strong>beamio.app</strong> and any related web, mobile, or developer interfaces we provide (collectively, the “Site”).
      </p>
      <p class="subtitle">
        By accessing or using the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Service.
      </p>
    </div>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section id="what-beamio-is">
      <h2>1. What Beamio Is (and Is Not)</h2>

      <h3>1.1 Interface, not a bank.</h3>
      <p>
        Beamio is a non-custodial interface that helps you send, request, and receive stablecoins (for example, USDC)
        on supported blockchains (currently including Base). We do not hold your funds, take custody of your private keys,
        or control your onchain assets.
      </p>

      <h3>1.2 No financial, investment, or legal advice.</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing on Beamio is investment advice, financial advice, or legal advice. You are solely responsible for your decisions
        and for complying with applicable laws in your jurisdiction.
      </p>

      <h3>1.3 No guarantee of availability.</h3>
      <p>
        The Service may change, be interrupted, or be discontinued at any time, including for maintenance, upgrades, or
        security reasons.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="eligibility">
      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Age.</h3>
      <p>
        You must be at least 18 years old (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) to use Beamio.
      </p>

      <h3>2.2 Restricted jurisdictions.</h3>
      <p>
        You may not use Beamio if doing so would violate applicable laws or if you are subject to sanctions or restrictions
        under any applicable regime. We may restrict or block access from certain jurisdictions at our discretion.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="responsibilities">
      <h2>3. Your Responsibilities</h2>

      <h3>3.1 Wallets &amp; keys.</h3>
      <p>
        You are responsible for the security of your wallet, devices, and private keys. If you lose access to your wallet,
        we cannot recover your assets or reverse transactions.
      </p>

      <h3>3.2 Irreversible transactions.</h3>
      <p>
        Blockchain transactions (including those triggered through Beamio) are generally irreversible. Always double-check
        amounts, recipients, and network details before confirming.
      </p>

      <h3>3.3 Accurate information.</h3>
      <p>
        If you provide us with any information (such as an email address for waitlists or updates), you agree that it is
        accurate and that you have the right to use it.
      </p>

      <h3>3.4 Lawful use.</h3>
      <p>
        You agree not to use Beamio for any illegal, fraudulent, or prohibited activities, including money laundering,
        terrorist financing, sanctions evasion, or any activity that violates applicable law or these Terms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="fees">
      <h2>4. Fees &amp; Payments</h2>

      <h3>4.1 Beamio service fees.</h3>
      <p>
        Beamio may charge service fees for certain actions, for example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>0% Beamio fee for direct “Send” transfers between friends;</li>
        <li>Percentage + minimum / maximum fees for check codes, payment links, and merchant features;</li>
        <li>Other clearly disclosed fees for premium or business functionality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The specific fees applicable to the Service are described in the product interface and/or on our pricing page.
        By using the Service, you agree to the fees shown at the time of the transaction.
      </p>

      <h3>4.2 Network fees &amp; sponsored gas.</h3>
      <p>
        Underlying blockchains may charge network fees (“gas”). In some cases, Beamio or its partners may sponsor or abstract
        gas costs; in other cases, you may bear gas costs directly. Any “no gas” or “0 gas” experience refers to your user
        experience in the interface and does not guarantee that no gas is consumed on the underlying network.
      </p>

      <h3>4.3 Third-party fees.</h3>
      <p>
        Your wallet provider, exchange, or bank may charge additional fees. Beamio is not responsible for such fees.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="non-custodial">
      <h2>5. Non-Custodial Nature</h2>

      <h3>5.1 You stay in control.</h3>
      <p>
        Beamio does not hold, freeze, or move your assets on your behalf. When you confirm a transaction, it is broadcast
        from your wallet (or smart account) to the network.
      </p>

      <h3>5.2 Smart contracts &amp; protocols.</h3>
      <p>
        Beamio may display or interact with smart contracts (for example, for check codes, payment links, or account
        abstraction). We do not control these protocols once deployed. You are responsible for understanding the risks
        of using them.
      </p>

      <h3>5.3 No FDIC or deposit insurance.</h3>
      <p>
        Your digital assets are not deposits, are not insured by the FDIC or any government agency, and may lose value.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="third-party-services">
      <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
      <p>
        Beamio may integrate with or link to third-party services, including blockchain networks, wallets, analytics tools,
        or payment partners. We do not control and are not responsible for third-party services. Your use of third-party
        services may be subject to their own terms and privacy policies.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="beta-warranty">
      <h2>7. Beta, Changes &amp; No Warranties</h2>

      <h3>7.1 Beta / MVP.</h3>
      <p>
        Parts of Beamio may be labeled as “beta” or “MVP”. These features may be incomplete, may change without notice,
        and may not function as expected.
      </p>

      <h3>7.2 No warranties.</h3>
      <p>
        The Service is provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied,
        including without limitation warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement,
        or that the Service will be error-free or secure.
      </p>

      <h3>7.3 Risk acknowledgement.</h3>
      <p>
        You understand that using blockchain technology and digital assets involves risks, including smart contract bugs,
        network congestion, changes to protocol rules, loss of private keys, and price volatility.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="limitation-liability">
      <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by law:
      </p>

        use of the Service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our total liability arising from or related to the Service will not exceed the greater of:
        (a) the amount of fees you paid to Beamio for the Service in the 3 months preceding the event giving rise to the claim,
        or (b) USD $50.

        from any claims, damages, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of
        or relating to:

        after changes take effect, you agree to the revised Terms.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="governing-law">
      <h2>11. Governing Law &amp; Disputes</h2>
      <p>
        These Terms are governed by the laws of [State / Country], without regard to its conflict of law rules.
      </p>
      <p>
